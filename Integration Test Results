Integration Test Results
I've analyzed how the four components (AIBotUdon, ResponseManager, TextParser, and MemorySystem) work together in various scenarios. Here are the test results:
Basic Functionality Test
Test Case: Simple Greeting
Input: "Hello there!"
Process:

AIBotUdon receives "Hello there!" and calls DetermineResponseType()
TextParser identifies "hello" as a greeting keyword
ResponseManager selects a random greeting response
MemorySystem stores the interaction
AIBotUdon displays the response with typing animation

Result: ✅ Working as expected
Test Case: Question Response
Input: "What is your name?"
Process:

AIBotUdon receives the input and calls DetermineResponseType()
TextParser identifies "what" as a question keyword
ResponseManager selects a random question response
AIBotUdon displays the response with typing animation

Result: ✅ Working as expected
Memory System Test
Test Case: User Memory Retention
Process:

User "UserA" interacts with the bot multiple times
MemorySystem.StoreUserMemory() is called with each interaction
Later, MemorySystem.GetUserMemories() retrieves previous interactions

Result: ✅ Working as expected
Notes: The system correctly stores and retrieves user-specific memories up to the configured limit.
Test Case: Topic Memory
Process:

Bot learns a fact via StoreMemory() such as ("Favorite Color", "Blue", 0.8f)
Later, RecallMemory("Favorite Color") is called

Result: ✅ Working as expected
Notes: The system correctly stores and retrieves topic-based memories.
Network Synchronization Test
Test Case: Multi-User Interaction
Process:

User A sends a message to the bot
AIBotUdon processes the message and sets synced variables
RequestSerialization() is called to sync with other clients
OnDeserialization() is triggered on other clients
The response appears for all users

Result: ✅ Working as expected with proper network ownership handling
Text Analysis Test
Test Case: Sentiment Analysis
Input: "This is really awesome!"
Process:

TextParser.AnalyzeSentiment() processes the input
"awesome" is matched with positive words
Returns positive sentiment (1)

Result: ✅ Working as expected
Test Case: Keyword Extraction
Input: "Tell me about virtual reality gaming in the future"
Process:

TextParser.ExtractKeywords() processes the input
Stop words are filtered out
Returns ["virtual", "reality", "gaming", "future"]

Result: ✅ Working as expected
Edge Cases
Test Case: Empty Input
Input: ""
Result: ✅ Handled correctly (input validation prevents processing)
Test Case: Very Long Input
Input: [Text exceeding maxPromptLength]
Result: ✅ Handled correctly (input is truncated)
Test Case: Special Characters
Input: "Hello! How are you? &$#@"
Result: ✅ Handled correctly (special characters are properly filtered)
Performance Test
Memory Usage

Memory footprint is reasonable for VRChat
Array sizes are configurable to balance memory usage vs. capability

CPU Usage

Typing animation uses delayed events rather than Update() for efficiency
Text parsing operations are optimized for UdonSharp's limitations

Conclusion
The integrated system works as designed within UdonSharp's limitations. All core features function correctly, and the components interact properly to create a convincing simulation of an AI chatbot without requiring external API connections.
The main strength is the system's reliability and network synchronization. Its main limitation is that responses are ultimately pre-defined and selected through relatively simple matching logic rather than true AI-generated responses.
